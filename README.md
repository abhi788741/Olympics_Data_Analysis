## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Some potential EDA questions covered (or suggested to include):

- Which countries won the most medals overall?
- How has the medal tally changed over the years?
- Which sports/events have the highest number of medals?
- Gender-wise participation and medal analysis
- Top 10 athletes with the most gold medals
- Medals distribution by year and sport

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values (e.g., in `Medal` or `Athlete`)
- Ensured consistency in categorical fields like `Sport`, `Gender`, `Country`
- Removed duplicates if present
- Converted data types for better plotting and analysis


## 📈 Insights

Example insights (you can adjust or replace based on your actual results):

- The United States consistently tops the medal tally.
